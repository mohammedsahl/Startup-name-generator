# Test Application

An application I created to get my feet wet in Flutter/Dart development

## Getting Started

A few resources I used to get started since this is my first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
- [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)
